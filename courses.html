						<h1>Electrician</h1>

						<p>Italian Renaissance polymath: painter, sculptor, architect, musician, mathematician, engineer, inventor, anatomist, geologist, cartographer, botanist, and writer. His genius, perhaps more than that of any other figure, epitomized the Renaissance humanist ideal. Leonardo has often been described as the archetype of the Renaissance Man, a man of "unquenchable curiosity" and "feverishly inventive imagination". He is widely considered to be one of the greatest painters of all time and perhaps the most diversely talented person ever to have lived. According to art historian Helen Gardner, the scope and depth of his interests were without precedent and "his mind and personality seem to us superhuman, the man himself mysterious and remote". Marco Rosci states that while there is much speculation about Leonardo, his vision of the world is essentially logical rather than mysterious, and that the empirical methods he employed were unusual for his time.</p>

						<h1>Fitter</h1>

						<p>German-born theoretical physicist who developed the general theory of relativity, one of the two pillars of modern physics (alongside quantum mechanics). While best known for his mass–energy equivalence formula E = mc2 (which has been dubbed "the world's most famous equation"), he received the 1921 Nobel Prize in Physics "for his services to theoretical physics, and especially for his discovery of the law of the photoelectric effect". The latter was pivotal in establishing quantum theory.</p>
						<p>Near the beginning of his career, Einstein thought that Newtonian mechanics was no longer enough to reconcile the laws of classical mechanics with the laws of the electromagnetic field. This led to the development of his special theory of relativity. He realized, however, that the principle of relativity could also be extended to gravitational fields, and with his subsequent theory of gravitation in 1916, he published a paper on the general theory of relativity.</p>

            <h1>Fitter</h1>

            <p style="margin-top: 10px;">German-born theoretical physicist who developed the general theory of relativity, one of the two
              pillars of modern physics (alongside quantum mechanics). While best known for his mass–energy
              equivalence formula E = mc2 (which has been dubbed "the world's most famous equation"), he received
              the 1921 Nobel Prize in Physics "for his services to theoretical physics, and especially for his
              discovery of the law of the photoelectric effect". The latter was pivotal in establishing quantum
              theory.</p>
            <p>Near the beginning of his career, Einstein thought that Newtonian mechanics was no longer enough to
              reconcile the laws of classical mechanics with the laws of the electromagnetic field. This led to
              the development of his special theory of relativity. He realized, however, that the principle of
              relativity could also be extended to gravitational fields, and with his subsequent theory of
              gravitation in 1916, he published a paper on the general theory of relativity.</p>

            <h1>Electrician</h1>

            <p style="margin-top: 10px;">Italian Renaissance polymath: painter, sculptor, architect, musician, mathematician, engineer,
              inventor, anatomist, geologist, cartographer, botanist, and writer. His genius, perhaps more than
              that of any other figure, epitomized the Renaissance humanist ideal. Leonardo has often been
              described as the archetype of the Renaissance Man, a man of "unquenchable curiosity" and "feverishly
              inventive imagination". He is widely considered to be one of the greatest painters of all time and
              perhaps the most diversely talented person ever to have lived. According to art historian Helen
              Gardner, the scope and depth of his interests were without precedent and "his mind and personality
              seem to us superhuman, the man himself mysterious and remote". Marco Rosci states that while there
              is much speculation about Leonardo, his vision of the world is essentially logical rather than
              mysterious, and that the empirical methods he employed were unusual for his time.</p>
