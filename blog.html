                  <h1>COPA</h1>
                  <p>Serbian-American inventor, electrical engineer, mechanical engineer, physicist, and futurist best
                    known for his contributions to the design of the modern alternating current (AC) electrical supply
                    system.</p>
                  <p>Tesla started working in the telephony and electrical fields before emigrating to the United States
                    in 1884 to work for Thomas Edison. He soon struck out on his own with financial backers, setting up
                    laboratories/companies to develop a range of electrical devices. His patented AC induction motor and
                    transformer were licensed by George Westinghouse, who also hired Tesla as a consultant to help
                    develop an alternating current system. Tesla is also known for his high-voltage, high-frequency
                    power experiments in New York and Colorado Springs which included patented devices and theoretical
                    work used in the invention of radio communication, for his X-ray experiments, and for his ill-fated
                    attempt at intercontinental wireless transmission in his unfinished Wardenclyffe Tower project.</p>

                  <h1>Electrician</h1>

                  <p>Italian Renaissance polymath: painter, sculptor, architect, musician, mathematician, engineer,
                    inventor, anatomist, geologist, cartographer, botanist, and writer. His genius, perhaps more than
                    that of any other figure, epitomized the Renaissance humanist ideal. Leonardo has often been
                    described as the archetype of the Renaissance Man, a man of "unquenchable curiosity" and "feverishly
                    inventive imagination". He is widely considered to be one of the greatest painters of all time and
                    perhaps the most diversely talented person ever to have lived. According to art historian Helen
                    Gardner, the scope and depth of his interests were without precedent and "his mind and personality
                    seem to us superhuman, the man himself mysterious and remote". Marco Rosci states that while there
                    is much speculation about Leonardo, his vision of the world is essentially logical rather than
                    mysterious, and that the empirical methods he employed were unusual for his time.</p>

                  <h1>Fitter</h1>

                  <p>German-born theoretical physicist who developed the general theory of relativity, one of the two
                    pillars of modern physics (alongside quantum mechanics). While best known for his mass–energy
                    equivalence formula E = mc2 (which has been dubbed "the world's most famous equation"), he received
                    the 1921 Nobel Prize in Physics "for his services to theoretical physics, and especially for his
                    discovery of the law of the photoelectric effect". The latter was pivotal in establishing quantum
                    theory.</p>
                  <p>Near the beginning of his career, Einstein thought that Newtonian mechanics was no longer enough to
                    reconcile the laws of classical mechanics with the laws of the electromagnetic field. This led to
                    the development of his special theory of relativity. He realized, however, that the principle of
                    relativity could also be extended to gravitational fields, and with his subsequent theory of
                    gravitation in 1916, he published a paper on the general theory of relativity.</p>

                    <p>Newton's Principia formulated the laws of motion and universal gravitation that dominated

                      principles. By deriving Kepler's laws of planetary motion from his mathematical description of
                      gravity, Newton removed the last doubts about the validity of the heliocentric model of the

                      contributions to optics and shares credit with Gottfried Leibniz for the invention of the
                      infinitesimal calculus.</p>
                    <p>Newton's Principia formulated the laws of motion and universal gravitation that dominated
                      scientists' view of the physical universe for the next three centuries. It also demonstrated that
                      the motion of objects on the Earth and that of celestial bodies could be described by the same
                      principles. By deriving Kepler's laws of planetary motion from his mathematical description of
                      gravity, Newton removed the last doubts about the validity of the heliocentric model of the
                      cosmos.</p>
